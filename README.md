# Compulsive Behavior Block Lists

## Overview

This repository contains curated block lists designed to help individuals manage and reduce three interconnected forms of compulsive consumption: **shopping addiction**, **gear acquisition syndrome**, and **media consumption addiction**. These lists target websites, apps, and services that enable and encourage excessive purchasing and media consumption patterns.

## Understanding the Addictions

### 🛍️ Shopping Addiction (Compulsive Buying Disorder)
An uncontrollable urge to shop and spend money, often driven by emotional needs rather than actual necessity. It can lead to financial hardship, debt, and emotional distress.

### ⚙️ Gear Acquisition Syndrome (GAS)
A specific form of shopping addiction where individuals obsessively purchase equipment, tools, or gear (particularly in hobbies like music, photography, gaming, etc.) in the belief that newer or more items will improve their skills or experience. Despite owning adequate equipment, the desire to acquire more is persistent and often irrational.

### 📱 Media Consumption Addiction
Compulsive use of social media, video streaming, and entertainment platforms characterized by excessive screen time, endless scrolling, and binge-watching. It negatively impacts mental health, productivity, sleep, and real-world relationships.

## Purpose

These block lists serve as practical tools for:

- **Reducing temptation** by blocking access to known platforms during moments of weakness
- **Creating friction** in compulsive browsing and purchasing patterns to allow time for reflection
- **Supporting recovery** for individuals working to develop healthier consumption habits
- **Breaking cycles** of habitual behavior and algorithmic manipulation
- **Protecting mental and financial health** from the designed addictiveness of these platforms
